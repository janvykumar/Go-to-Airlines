long-haul travel between business and economy class. Let’s Go Airlines will operate
Boeing 757-200 aircraft configured with 80 seats which will provide a very spacious and
pleasant environment. The aircraft will be equipped with the latest technology in order to
enable the business traveller to use his time efficiently while travelling. The company will
start by leasing two aircraft and expand its fleet to 6 aircraft by the second year of

  premium/business segment of the market. It will offer customers a compelling value
  proposition: a high level of service and comfort at 50 percent of the current published
  business-class fare. In addition to an attractive price, Let’s Go will offer passengers
  considerable time savings, convenience, and will focus on creating a lifestyle appeal.</p>
